  WebSockets for Real-Time Updates

  This project uses Django Channels to send real-time notifications to users about ticket creation, task assignments, status updates, and more.
  Users will be notified instantly via WebSockets when:
    1. A new ticket is created.
    2. A task is assigned or reassigned.
    3. The status of a ticket or task changes.
